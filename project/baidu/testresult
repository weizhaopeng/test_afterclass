The Great **** of China is a series of fortifications made of *****, *****, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC;[2] these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great ****.[3] Especially famous is the **** built 220���C206 BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that **** remains. Since then, the Great **** has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing **** is from the Ming Dynasty. Other purposes of the Great **** have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great **** were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great **** also served as a transportation corridor.
